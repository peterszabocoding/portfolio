        <h1>Hello.</h1>
        <h2>A bit about me</h2>
        <p>My name is <b>Peter Szabo</b> and I have been developing software professionally since 2015.</p>

        <p>Over the years, I have worked with both small startups and large enterprises, contributing to a diverse 
          range of projects. I developed a mobile streaming application, enhanced an app for one of the largest 
          companies in the Travel and Accommodation industry, and participated in the development of in-flight 
          entertainment systems.</p>

        <p>Years of work and experience made me committed to high-quality software development with a strong 
            emphasis on robust architecture and comprehensive testing. Industry legends Robert C. Martin and Martin Fowler shaped 
              my views on software engineering. Their books on clean code, software architecture, and professional practices 
            had a significant impact on how I approach software development today. </p>

        <p>In 2021 I left software engineering to pursue my passion for 3D art and video games. The first ever video game I worked on,  
          Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was released at the end of 2024.
        </p>

        <p>In the past years I have been working on my own projects focusing on the C++ programming language and graphics 
          APIs such as OpenGL and Vulkan.</p>

            <h3>MongooseVK</h3>
            <p>A personal project focused on learning the Vulkan API through building 
              a real-time physically based renderer. It features image-based lighting (IBL), 
              screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO), and a modern rendering architecture in development, including plans for a 
              frame graph system. The project serves as a foundation for exploring advanced graphics techniques and low-level GPU programming.</p>

            <h3>OpenGL Renderer</h3>
            <p>A real-time renderer built with OpenGL, featuring physically based rendering (PBR) 
              for realistic lighting and materials. It includes a modular scene management system based 
              on an entity-component architecture, and supports dynamic lighting with directional, point, 
              and spot lights. Advanced shadow rendering is achieved through a shadow map atlas. 
              The renderer also offers an interactive editor with object selection and manipulation tools, 
              along with real-time atmospheric scattering for realistic sky simulation.</p>
